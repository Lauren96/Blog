      <h3>Defining Your Style</h3>
      <p> Having your own unique style is important for artists. It creates a sense of branding for our work that makes people see it and say,'Oh, I know this!' However, this also creates a lot of stress for beginners. Establishing your style will come naturally over time as you learn and refine your skills, so don't be afraid to try well known styles and see which kinds you resonate with! The 'you' in your brand is cultivated over time, and will be a mix of things you've seen with your own twist on it. </p>

        <h3> Basic Shapes </h3>
          <p> Just like a child learns with blocks, so must an artist learn with shapes. By mastering smooth lines and proportional circles, you can lay the foundation for complicated design and intricate illustrations later! Basic shapes and perspectives are integral skills for an experienced artist. </p>

        <h3> Anatomy </h3>
          <p> Anatomy is a funny thing, especially in cartooning. If the anatomy is off just a little bit, your character will look wrong and wonky. However, if you exaggerate anatomy, the character will look interesting and iconic! There is a decision to make when making a cartoon: Do I make this look somewhat realistic, or completely obnoxious? </p>

        <h3> Adding Detail </h3>
          <p> When I first started drawing, I would make my pictures from the top down. Donâ€™t do that. Your picture will look so much more polished if you start with your basic shapes and build up from there. Clothing looks more realistic if you make the body first, then dress it up afterwards. This keeps everything proportional! </p>

        <h3> Shading and Textures </h3>
          <p> To give your illustrations extra depth, shading and texturing is a must! Shading and texturing techniques work well with layers, too. Keeping everything separated will allow you to edit individual sections without interfering with work you've already completed and are satisfied with. This can be the part of the project that takes the longest, so save frequently! </p>

        <h3> The Effects of a Good Background </h3>
          <p> Once your character is finished, you might be proud of what you're looking at, but there's still that nagging feeling that something is missing...What you're looking for, is a background! Even the simplest of backgrounds can give your character the spotlight they deserve! </p>

        <h3> Using Layers to Color </h3>
          <p> Layers are an easy to master tool that will save you hours of time. Using layers to color is something that professionals use, as well as hobbyists. Once you have your line art, you can use layer underneath it for quick coloring and editing without interfering with the drawing above, or other color layers. </p>
