      <h3>Defining Your Style</h3>
      <p> Having your own unique style is important for artists. It creates a sense of branding for our work that makes people see it and say,'Oh, I know this!' However, this also creates a lot of stress for beginners. Establishing your style will come naturally over time as you learn and refine your skills, so don't be afraid to try well known styles and see which kinds you resonate with! The 'you' in your brand is cultivated over time, and will be a mix of things you've seen with your own twist on it. </p>

        <h3> The Effects of a Good Background </h3>
          <p> Ever spent hours on a picture and wondered why it still feels like there's something missing? You might want to add a background! Backgrounds add contrast that compliments a picture, even if it's just a simple gradient! If you really want to do right by a character you've spent time creating, give them a background they can really shine against! </p>
